## Summary
The main principles of the decisions made for this project are:

<li>Make it simple to discover offers</li>
<li>Find matches fast</li>

<br>

The products of this principles are the Room Switch Forum and the Offer Butler. 

The Room Switch Forum provides a common structure for offers which enables us to create a filter feature where users can see offers matching different criterias. When a user has listed an offer, finding matches to their specified preferences is very fast and takes no more than two clicks.

The Offer Butler uploads posts (not only about room switch, but also subletting) at a regular interval of users' own choice to [The UBC Housing Forum](https://forums.housing.ubc.ca/) to keep them from getting buried and remain discoverable to new visitors.


## Problem
[The UBC Housing Forum](https://forums.housing.ubc.ca/) has actually provided a place where people exchange rooms, but it is not tailored to facilitate room exchange. The posts are simple texts with no common structure. This makes it hard for new users to find older posts which are still open. Once a user's post gets buried and the user's post is not a room which is in a highly desirable area, the user will be left with no chance for room exchange.

## Solution
The Room Switch Forum gives a common convention for all offers to make it suitable to do programatical manipulations to help users keep their offers discoverable. Keeping offers from getting buried also only takes no more than two clicks with the "Bring Up" feture shown below.

The Offer Butler keeps posts from getting buried and remain discoverable in [UBC Housing Forum](https://forums.housing.ubc.ca/) by uploading posts at a regular basis to the forum while still respecting the forum by limiting the post upload interval to 24 hours.
